I am a researcher with a strong foundation in **computer systems**, now focusing on **large language models, reinforcement learning, and multi-agent systems**, with broader interests in **AI for Science and AI safety**. 

I hold a Master’s degree in Data Science from the University of Pennsylvania, where I completed coursework in machine learning, computer systems, algorithms, GPU computing, and artificial intelligence. I previously began a Ph.D. program in Computer Science at the University of Georgia, where my research focused on dynamic binary translation, system call emulation, and automated differential testing. I am currently preparing applications for top-tier CS Ph.D. programs centered on AI and machine learning.

My research experience spans low-level systems and runtime analysis—such as automated syscall testing for QEMU and differential testing frameworks—as well as recent work on large language models, reinforcement learning, and preference optimization. My background in computer systems and program analysis informs my approach to these problems, particularly in understanding efficiency, robustness, and real-world deployment constraints of LLM-based and multi-agent systems in scientific and safety-critical settings.

I have co-authored papers accepted to **SOSP 2025** and **ICSE 2026**, which provide a strong systems foundation for my current research. I am now actively developing new projects centered on large language models, reinforcement learning, and AI safety, with the goal of advancing the foundations of next-generation AI systems.

Please learn more about me from my [CV](files/CV_JI_2026.pdf)! Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or topics you'd like to discuss!
