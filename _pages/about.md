I am a researcher with a strong foundation in **computer systems**, now focusing on **large language models and reinforcement learning**, with the goal of building **efficient, robust, and trustworthy AI systems**.

I hold a Master’s degree in Data Science from the University of Pennsylvania, where I completed coursework in machine learning, computer systems, algorithms, GPU computing, and artificial intelligence. I previously began a Ph.D. program in Computer Science at the University of Georgia, where my research centered on **dynamic binary translation, system call emulation, and automated differential testing**. I am currently preparing applications for top-tier CS Ph.D. programs with a focus on AI and machine learning.

My research experience spans low-level systems and runtime analysis—such as automated syscall testing for QEMU and differential testing frameworks—as well as recent work on **large language models, reinforcement learning, and preference optimization**. I am particularly interested in how **systems and program optimization techniques can enable more reliable, scalable, and efficient LLM-based and multi-agent systems**.

I have co-authored papers accepted to **SOSP 2025** and **ICSE 2026**, and I am actively developing new research projects that bridge **systems, machine learning, and AI safety**, aiming to advance the foundations of next-generation AI systems.

**Please learn more about me from my [CV](files/CV_JI_2026.pdf)! Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or topics you'd like to discuss!**
